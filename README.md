This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), Drizzle from the Truffle team, and Rimble UI from the Consensys Design team.

See [Drizzle docs](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/drizzle/overview) for information about how to use Drizzle with your dapp.

Check out Rimble UI [here](https://github.com/ConsenSys/rimble-ui).

Note: Configure MetaMask to use Truffle Develop accounts by importing the seed phrase.
